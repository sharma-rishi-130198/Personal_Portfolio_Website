      <p>
        I am an efficient programmer, a strong thinker, and a disciplined professional. My curiosity to learn and passion for the field have driven me throughout my career, leading me to pursue an MS in Computer Science at RIT.         
        Programming is a joy for me. I look forward to joining a dynamic team where I can continue enjoying this passion for years and contribute my best to the company's success.
